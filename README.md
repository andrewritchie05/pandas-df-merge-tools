Tools created for a project which required merging multiple pandas data frames, with sporadic duplication and missing values for the same feature between the data frames. 

Tools can be used to remove duplicated features in place, and then create single (or multiple, if required) feature columns.

Example use: merging contact lists in which some contacts have the same cell number listed in all the data frames; some have different cell numbers (could be business/personal etc); and some have a cell number in only one data frame.
